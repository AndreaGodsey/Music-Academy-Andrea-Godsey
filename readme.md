# Assignment 3: Music Block Academy

### Concepts Covered

<p>For this week, we learned a better understanding of how to create templates and themes in WordPress. We specifically learned how to create blocks of code that enhances the color pallete, adds buttons, embeds videos, as well as other functionalities. We also learned how to create a navigation at the top of each page, as well as a footer, by using Javascript and WordPress block coding. </p>

### Techniques to Remember

<p>In order to group certain blocks of code together, you need to specify how many objects are in the group, and if it follows by row or column. This is similar to the coding techniques used in Visual Studio Code itself. An example of this being used is by grouping together the client testimonials into columns of three, this way the website does not have too much empty space. In order to change the theme, or color pallete, of the website, this can be handled in a json file.  In this file, you are able to change the background and text colors on the page. </p>
